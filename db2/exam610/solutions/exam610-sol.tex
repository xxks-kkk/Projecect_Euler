% \question[10] Differentiate $f(x)=x^2$ with respect to $x$.
\question[1]
A database will be used primarily to identify sales patterns
for products sold within the last three years and to summarize
sales by region, on a quarterly basis. Which type of system is 
needed?
\begin{choices}
\choice Analytical
\choice DB2 pureScale
\CorrectChoice Data warehouse
\choice Online transaction processing (OLTP)
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
Data warehouses (\textit{Correct Answer C}) are typically used to store and manage large volumes of data that is often
historical in nature and that is used primarily for analysis. Thus, a data warehouse could be used to identify sales patterns
for products sold within the past three years or to summarize sales by region, on a quarterly basis. \textit{InfoSphere Warehouse} is offered for data warehouse.
\par

Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems (\textit{Answer D}), are designed to support day-to-day, mission-critical business
activities such as web-based order entry and stock trading. \textit{DB2 pureScale feature} is offered for OLTP workloads. 
\par

{\color{red} Analytical} workloads (\textit{Answer A}) are better handled by a specialized product
known as \textit{DB2 for i and by IBM BLU Acceleration}, which is currently available
only with DB2 10.5 for LUW.

\end{solution}

\question[1]
Which product can be used to tune performance for a single query?
\begin{choices}
\CorrectChoice IBM Data Studio
\choice IBM Control Center
\choice IBM Data Administrator
\choice IBM Workload Manager
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
\textit{IBM Data Studio} (\textit{Correct Answer A}) is an Eclipse-based, integrated
development environment (IDE) that can be used to perform instance and database
administration, routine (SQL procedure, SQL functions, etc.) and application
development, and performance-tuning tasks. It replaces the \textit{DB2 Control Center} 
(\textit{Answer B}) as the standard GUI tool for DB2 database administration and
application development.
\par

\textit{IBM Workload Manager}, or WLM (\textit{Answer D}) is a comprehensive workload
management feature that can help identify, manage, and control database workloads to
maximize database server \textcolor{red}{throughput} and \textcolor{red}{resource
 utilization}.
\par

\question[1]
Which two DB2 products are suitable for very large data warehouse applications? (Choose two.)
\begin{choices}
\choice DB2 for i
\CorrectChoice DB2 for AIX
\CorrectChoice DB2 for z/OS
\choice DB2 pureScale
\choice DB2 Express-C
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
\textit{DB2 for i} (\textit{Answer A}), formerly known as DB2 for i5/OS, is an
advanced, 64-bit Relational Database Management System that leverages the high
performance, virtualization, and energy efficiency features of IBM's Power Systems; 
its self-managing attributes, security, and built-in analytical processing functions
make \textit{DB2 for i} an ideal database server for {\color{red} applications that 
are analytical in nature}.
\par

\textit{DB2 for z/OS} (\textit{Correct Answer C}) is a multiuser, full-function
database management system that has been designed specifically for z/OS, 
IBM's flagship mainframe operating system. Tightly integrated with the IBM mainframe,
\textit{DB2 for z/OS} leverages the strengths of System z 64-bit architecture to
provide, among other things, the ability to support complex {\color{red} data
warehouses}. 
\par

In addition to DB2 for z/OS, all of the DB2 Editions available \textbf{except} 
\textit{DB2 Express-C} (\textit{Answer E}) and \textit{DB2 Express Edition} can be
used to create data warehouse and OLTP environments. \textbf{However},
IBM offers two solutions that are tailored specifically for one workload type or
the other: \textit{InfoSphere Warehouse} for {\color{red} data warehousing} workloads
and the \textit{DB2 pureScale Feature} (\textit{Answer D}) for {\color{red} OLTP}
workloads.

\end{solution}


\question[1]
What is the DB2 Workload Manager (WLM) used for?
\begin{choices}
\choice To identify, diagnose, solve, and prevent performance problems in DB2 products and associated applications.
\CorrectChoice To customize execution environments for the purpose of controlling system resources so that one
		department or service class does not overwhelm the system.
\choice To respond to significant changes in a database's workload by dynamically distributing available memory resources
		among several different database memory consumers.
\choice To improve the performance of applications that require frequent, but relatively transient, simultaneous user
		connections by allocating host database resources only for the duration of an SQL transaction.
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
\textit{IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager Extended Edition} can be used to 
identify, diagnose, solve, and prevent performance problems in DB2 products and
associated applications (\textit{Answer A})
\par

With \textit{DB2 Workload Manager}, it is possible to customize execution
environments so that no single workload can control and consume all of the system
resources available. (This prevents any one department or service class from
overwhelming the system.) (\textit{Correct Answer B})
\par

The \textit{Self-Tuning Memory Manager (STMM)} responds to significant changes in
a database's workload by dynamically distributing available memory resources among
several different database memory consumers. (\textit{Answer C})
\par

The \textit{Connection Concentrator} improves the performance of applications that
require frequent, but relatively transient, simultaneous user connections by
allocating host database resources only for the duration of an SQL transaction. 
(\textit{Answer D})

\end{solution}


\question[1]
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a data warehouse?
\begin{choices}
\CorrectChoice Sub-second response time
\choice Voluminous historical data
\choice Heterogeneous data sources
\choice Summarized queries that perform aggregations and joins
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
Sub-second response time is a feature of OLTP systems.
\end{solution}

\question[1]
Which statement about the DB2 pureScale feature is NOT true?
\begin{choices}
\choice The DB2 pureScale feature provides a database cluster solution for nonmainframe platforms.

\question[1]
Which two statements about large object (LOB) locators are true? (Choose two.)
\begin{choices}
\CorrectChoice A LOB locator represents a value for a LOB resource that is stored in a database.
\CorrectChoice A LOB locator is a simple token value that is used to refer to a much bigger LOB value.
\choice A LOB locator is a special data type that is used to store LOB data in external binary files.
\choice A LOB locator represents a value for a LOB resource that is stored in an external binary file.
\choice A LOB locator is a mechanism that acts similar to an index in the way that is organizes LOB values
		so they can be quickly located in response to a query.
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
A LOB locator is a mechanism that refers to a LOB value from within a transaction.
LOB locator is \textbf{NOT} a data type (\textit{Answer C}), nor is it a database
object. Instead, it is a token value-in the form of a host variable-that is used to
refer to a much bigger LOB value.
\par

LOB data types-\textbf{not LOB locators}-are used to store binary data values in a DB2 database
\textit{Answer D}.
\par

LOB locators \textbf{do not} store copies of LOB data (this is make it different from index)-they
store a description of a base LOB value, and the actual data that a LOB locator refers to is only
materialized when it is assigned to a specific location, such as an application host variable or
another table record (\textit{Answer E})


\end{solution}

\question[1]
Which type of database workload typically involves making changes to a small number of records within
a single transaction?
\begin{choices}
\choice Decision support
\choice Data warehousing
\choice Online analytical processing (OLAP)
\CorrectChoice Online transaction processing (OLTP)
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
An online transaction processing (OLTP) environment often consists of hundreds to thousands of
users issuing millions of transactions per day against databases that vary in size.
Consequently, the volume of data affected may be very large, even though {\color{red} each transaction
typically makes changes to only a small number of records}.
\par

Data warehousing (\textit{Answer B}) involves storing and managing large volumes of data that is often 
historical in nature and that is used primarily for analysis. Consequently, data warehouses are frequently
used in reporting, online analytical processing (OLAP) (\textit{Answer C}), and decision support 
(\textit{Answer A}) environments.


\end{solution}


\question[1]
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of an OLTP database?
\begin{choices}
\choice Current data
\choice Frequent updates
\choice Granular transactions
\CorrectChoice Optimized for queries
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
Data warehouse workloads typically consist of:
\begin{itemize}
\item bulk load operations
\item short-running queries
\item long-running complex queries
\item random queries
\item occasional updates to data
\item execution of online utilities
\end{itemize}
Therefore, data warehouses are optimized for queries (\textit{Correct Answer D}).
\par

Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems features:
\begin{itemize}
\item Support day-to-day, mission-critical business activities
\item Support hundreds to thousands of users issuing millions of transactions per day (\textit{Answer C})
against databases that vary in size
\item Response time requirements tend to be subsecond
\item Workloads tend to be a mix of real-time insert, update (\textit{Answer B}), and delete
operations against current-as opposed to historical-data (\textit{Answer A})
\end{itemize}

\end{solution}

\question[1]
Which two platforms support DB2 10.1 pureScale environments? (Choose two.)
\begin{choices}
\choice IBM mainframes running z/OS
\CorrectChoice IBM p Series servers running AIX
\choice IBM p Series servers running Linux
\CorrectChoice IBM x Series servers running Linux
\choice IBM x Series servers running a supported version of Windows
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
\textit{DB2 pureScale (Version 10.1)} can \textbf{ONLY} be installed on IBM p Series or x Series
servers that are running either the AIX (p Series) or the Linux (x Series) operating system.
\par

\textit{DB2 pureScale} \textbf{CANNOT} be installed on IBM mainframes running z/OS (\textit{Answer A}),
IBM p Series servers running Linux (\textit{Answer C}), or IBM x Series servers running Windows
(\textit{Answer E}).

\question[1]
Which tool can analyze and provide recommendations for tuning individual queries?
\begin{choices}
\choice IBM InfoSphere Data Architect
\CorrectChoice IBM InfoSphere Optim Query Tuner
\choice IBM InfoSphere Optim pureQuery Runtime
\choice IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager Extended Edition
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
\textit{IBM InfoSphere Data Architect} offers a complete solution for designing, modeling,
discovering, relating, and standardizing data assets (\textit{Answer A}).
\par

\textit{IBM InfoSphere Optim Query Tuner}, often referred to as the Query Tuner, can analyze
and make recommendations on ways to tune existing queries, as well as provide expert advice
on writing new queries (\textit{Correct Answer B}).
\par

\textit{IBM InfoSphere Optim pureQuery Runtime} bridges the gap between data and Java technology
by harnessing the power of SQL within an easy-to-use Java data access platform (\textit{Answer C}).
\par

\textit{IBM InfoSphere Optim Performance Manager Extended Edition} can identify, diagnose, solve, 
and prevent performance problems in DB2 products and associated applications (\textit{Answer D}).


\end{solution}

\question[1]
Which SQL statement will create a table named EMPLOYEE that can be used to store XML data?
\begin{choices}
\CorrectChoice CREATE TABLE employee (empid INT, resume XML)
\choice CREATE TABLE employee (empid INT, resume XML(2000))
\choice CREATE TABLE employee (empid INT, resume CLOB AS XML)
\choice CREATE TABLE employee (empid INT, resume CLOB USING XML)
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
The \textit{DB2 pureXML} offers a simple and efficient way to create a "hybrid" DB2 database
that allows XML data to be stored in its native, hierarchical format. With \textit{pureXML}, XML
documents are stored in tables that contain one or more columns that have been defined with
the XML data type.
\par

Since the XML data type does not require a size specification (\textit{Answer B}), and because
"CLOB AS XML" (\textit{Answer C}) and "CLOB USING XML" (\textit{Answer D}) are not valid column
definitions, the only CREATE TABLE statement shown that will execute successfully is:

\begin{verbatim}
CREATE TABLE employee (empid INT, resume XML)
\end{verbatim}


\end{solution}


\question[1]
What DB2 product provides a complete data warehousing solution that contains components
that facilitate data warehouse construction and administration?
\begin{choices}
\choice DB2 pureScale Feature
\choice DB2 Workload Manager
\CorrectChoice IBM InfoSphere Warehouse
\choice Database Partitioning Feature
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
\textit{DB2 pureScale Feature} enables a DB2 for LUW database to continuously process incoming requests,
even if multiple system componets fail simultaneously, which makes it ideal for OLTP workloads where 
high availability is crucial (\textit{Answer A}).
\par

\textit{DB2 Workload Manager (WLM)} is a comprehensive workload management feature that can help identify,
manage, and control database workloads to maximize database server throughput and resource utilization
(\textit{Answer B}).
\par

\textit{IBM InfoSphere Warehouse} is a complete data warehousing solution that contains components
that facilitate data warehouse construction and administration, as well as tools that enable
embedded data mining and multidimensional online analytical processing (OLAP) (\textit{Correct Answer C}).
\par

\textit{Data Partitioning Feature (DPF)} provides the ability to divide very large databases into 
multiple parts (known as partitions) and store them across a cluster of inexpensive servers 
(\textit{Answer D}).

\end{solution}

\question[1]
Which statement about IBM Data Studio is NOT true?
\begin{choices}
\CorrectChoice The IBM Data Studio administration client can be installed on servers running 
Red Hat Linux, SUSE Linux, Windows, and AIX.
\choice IBM Data Studio replaces the DB2 Control Center as the standard GUI interface for DB2 
database administration and application development.
\choice IBM Data Studio is an Eclipsed-based, integrated development environment (IDE) that can be 
used to perform instance and database administration.
\choice IBM Data Studio allows users to connect to a DB2 database using a wizard; however, users 
are required to provide login credentials before a connection will be established.
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
There are three different IBM Data Studio components to choose from: \textit{IBM Data Studio
administration client}, \textit{IBM Data Studio full client}, and \textit{IBM Data Studio web console}.
All three components can be installed on servers running Red Hat Linux, SUSE Linux, and Windows; 
IBM Data Studio web console can be installed on servers running the AIX operating system as well.
(\textbf{IBM Data Studio administration client cannot be installed on AIX servers}).

\end{solution}

\question[1]
Which statement about inline large objects (LOBs) is NOT true?
\begin{choices} 
\choice When a table contains columns with inline LOBs, fewer rows can fit on a page.
\choice Inline LOBs are created by appending the INLINE LENGTH clause to a LOB column's definition.
\CorrectChoice Because DML operations against inline LOBs are never logged, their use can reduce logging overhead.
\choice Inline LOBs improve query performance by storing LOB data in the same data pages as the rest of a
table's rows, rather than in a separate LOB storage object.
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
By default, Large object (LOB) data is stored in separate LOB storage objects and changes to LOB data
are not recorded in transaction log files. However, LOBs that are relatively small can be stored in the
same data pages as the rest of a table's rows-such LOBs are referred to as \textit{inline LOBs}, and
transactions that modify inline LOB data are always logged. Consequently, the use of inline LOBs can
increase-\textbf{not reduce}-logging overhead.
\par

Inline LOBs are created by appending the INLINE LENGTH clause to a LOB column's definition (\textit{Answer B}), which can be specified via the \texttt{CREATE TABLE} or \texttt{ALTER TABLE} statement. Inline LOBs
improve the performance of queries that access LOB data since no additional I/O is needed to access
this type of data (\textit{Answer D}). However, when a table has columns with inline LOBs in it,
fewer rows will fit on a page (\textit{Answer A}).
