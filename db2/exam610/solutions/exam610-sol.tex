% Basic question

% \question[10] Differentiate $f(x)=x^2$ with respect to $x$.
\question[1]
A database will be used primarily to identify sales patterns
for products sold within the last three years and to summarize
sales by region, on a quarterly basis. Which type of system is 
needed?
\begin{choices}
\choice Analytical
\choice DB2 pureScale
\CorrectChoice Data warehouse
\choice Online transaction processing (OLTP)
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
Data warehouses (\textit{Correct Answer C}) are typically used to store and manage large volumes of data that is often
historical in nature and that is used primarily for analysis. Thus, a data warehouse could be used to identify sales patterns
for products sold within the past three years or to summarize sales by region, on a quarterly basis. \textit{InfoSphere Warehouse} offered


\par

Online transaction processing (OLTP) systems (\textit{Answer D}), are designed to support day-to-day, mission-critical business
activities such as web-based order entry and stock trading. \par

\question[1]
What is the DB2 Workload Manager (WLM) used for?
\begin{choices}
\choice To identify, diagnose, solve, and prevent performance problems in DB2 products and associated applications.
\choice To customize execution environments for the purpose of controlling system resources so that one
		department or service class does not overwhelm the system.
\choice To respond to significant changes in a database's workload by dynamically distributing available memory resources
		among several different database memory consumers.
\choice To improve the performance of applications that require frequent, but relatively transient, simultaneous user
		connections by allocating host database resources only for the duration of an SQL transaction.
\end{choices}

\question[1]
Which of the following is NOT a characteristic of a data warehouse?
\begin{choices}
\choice Sub-second response time
\choice Voluminous historical data
\choice Heterogeneous data sources
\choice Summarized queries that perform aggregations and joins
\end{choices}

\newpage
\addpoints
\question[1]
Which statement about the DB2 pureScale feature is NOT true?
\begin{choices}
\choice The DB2 pureScale feature provides a database cluster solution for nonmainframe platforms.
\choice The DB2 pureScale feature is only available as part of DB2 Advanced Enterprise Server Edition.
\choice The DB2 pureScale feature can only work with the General Parallel File System (GPFS) file system.
\choice The DB2 pureScale feature is best suited for online transaction processing (OLTP) workloads.
\end{choices}

\question[1]
Which two statements about large object (LOB) locators are true? (Choose two.)
\begin{choices}
\choice A LOB locator represents a value for a LOB resource that is stored in a database.
\choice A LOB locator is a simple token value that is used to refer to a much bigger LOB value.
\choice A LOB locator is a special data type that is used to store LOB data in external binary files.
\choice A LOB locator represents a value for a LOB resource that is stored in an external binary file.
\choice A LOB locator is a mechanism that acts similar to an index in the way that is organizes LOB values
		so they can be quickly located in response to a query.
\end{choices}

a single transaction?
\begin{choices}

\choice DB2 Workload Manager
\choice IBM InfoSphere Warehouse
\choice Database Partitioning Feature

Which statement about IBM Data Studio is NOT true?
\begin{choices}
\choice The IBM Data Studio administration client can be installed on servers running Red Hat Linux, SUSE Linux,
		Windows, and AIX.
\choice IBM Data Studio replaces the DB2 Control Center as the standard GUI interface for DB2 database administration
		and application development.
\choice IBM Data Studio is an Eclipsed-based, integrated development environment (IDE) that can be used to perform
		instance and database administration.
\choice IBM Data Studio allows users to connect to a DB2 database using a wizard; however, users are required to provide
		login credentials before a connection will be established.
\end{choices}

\question[1]
Which statement about inline large objects (LOBs) is NOT true?
\begin{choices} 
\choice When a table contains columns with inline LOBs, fewer rows can fit on a page.
\choice Inline LOBs are created by appending the INLINE LENGTH clause to a LOB column's definition.
\choice Because DML operations against inline LOBs are never logged, their use can reduce logging overhead.
\choice Inline LOBs improve query performance by storing LOB data in the same data pages as the rest of a table's rows,
		rather than in a separate LOB storage object.
